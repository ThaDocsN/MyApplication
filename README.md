# MyApplication
I love gardening so I thought I would make an app that allows me to compare my harvest of previous grows. "sql"
I will need to hold data in a database.
Use a recycleviewer to hold plant info
  add animation to layout
Remind me to feed or water them. "broadcast receivers, pending intents"
allows me to search for articles for that particular plant "json, google api"
Play an animation when loading data from database "animations"
